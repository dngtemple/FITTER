# FITTER APP
mechanic fitter app project I am building together with other frontend developers

FITTER APPLICATION
Main Functionalities of the app:
1. Requesting mechanical assistance.
2. Locating mechanical shops.
Minor functionalities of the app:
1. Determining the location of the user.
2. Communicating with an administrator through a live chat feature.
3. A map location of the user, mechanical shops, and mechanical assistors.
How the app would be used:
On the homepage, there would be an SOS button and a FIND button. When the SOS 
button is clicked, the user gets two options:
a. Request for mechanical assistance.
b. Chat with administrator.
When FIND button is clicked, the location of nearby mechanical shops would be 
displayed on a map. User selects preferred shop and is given directions.
The purpose of this app is to resolve the issue of relying on a specific fittering company 
which may prove unreliable at times. We are providing a 24 hours reliable solutions to 
mechanical issues regardless of the place and time of the issue
